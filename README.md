# Blockchain

A simple example of a blockchain using a Flask API to interact with it and the Docker framework acting as the engine.

## Installation

Instructions to install assuming you have Docker installed:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
# Then browse to say, 'http://localhost:5000/chain'
```

You can adjust the number of simulations schedule inside the client.py script to whatever you want.  I understand this is not a perfect blockchain, but this is a prototype I came up with so that I can use the core understanding in the future.
