# Blockchain

A simple example of a blockchain using a Flask API to interact with it

---

## Installation

I was using Python 3.6.8 at the time of creating this example...

Instructions to install assuming you have Python installed:

```bash
python3.6 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
python client.py
```

You can adjust the number of simulations schedule inside the client.py script to whatever you want.  I understand this is not a perfect blockchain, but this is a prototype I came up with so that I can use the core understanding in the future.
